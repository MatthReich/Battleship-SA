# Battleship-SA

Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids on which each player's fleet of ships (including battleships) are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.

Battleship is known worldwide as a pencil and paper game which dates from World War I. Here it is as a Scala Project for PC.
